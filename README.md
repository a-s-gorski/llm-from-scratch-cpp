# LLM from Scratch in C++

This project is an implementation of a Language Model (LLM) built from scratch using C++. The primary objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of LLMs by building one from the ground up.

## Features

- **Tokenization and Text Preprocessing**: Efficient handling of input text.
- **Neural Network Implementation**: Custom-built neural network layers and architecture.
- **Training and Inference Pipeline**: End-to-end pipeline for model training and evaluation.
- **Configurable Hyperparameters**: Easily adjustable settings for experimentation.

## Prerequisites

- **C++17 or later**
- **CMake 3.15+**
- **A compatible compiler** (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- **CUDA 12.1** (for GPU acceleration)

## Build Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-from-scratch-cpp.git
    cd llm-from-scratch-cpp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    chmod +x scripts/*
    ./scripts/install_boost.sh
    ./scripts/install_torch.sh
    ```

3. **Create a build directory and compile**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake --build . --target all -j$(nproc)
    ```

4. **Run the executables**:
    ```bash
    cd build/bin
    ./train_tokenizer    # Train the tokenizer
    ./train_model        # Train the language model
    ./run_model          # Run inference with the trained model
    ```
